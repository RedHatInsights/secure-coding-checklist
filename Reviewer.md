- Code changes are reviewed by someone other than the original code author and who is knowledgeable about code review techniques and secure coding practices. Just because someone can develop code doesn’t mean that they can review code, so it’s vital that whoever is responsible for code review is properly trained in how to do this. It’s also important that code reviews are performed by someone other than the developer of the code to allow for an objective review.

- Code reviews ensure code is developed according to secure coding guidelines.

- Appropriate corrections are implemented prior to release. If a security vulnerability is discovered and is not corrected, this puts your application at risk. The PCI DSS also points out, “Faulty code is far more difficult and expensive to address after it has been deployed or released into production environments.”

- Code review results are reviewed and approved by management prior to production. This isn’t suggesting that management performs the code review, but rather, management signs off that the necessary corrections have been made and the development process is working as it’s defined.
